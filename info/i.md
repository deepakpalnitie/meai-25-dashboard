What I am asking in the metric, would be a constant number that I know in advance. Wouldn't it be nice if I give that number and units, it gets shown directly instad of getting multiplied? It seems straight forward and easier to manage from my end as well. For example I can say Farmer Income Increase (projected) if 10000, units: Rs per acre, similarly Urea Subsidy Saved (projected) is 600kg CO2eq per farmer per acre etc.
